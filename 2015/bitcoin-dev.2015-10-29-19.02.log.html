<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">19:03:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> suggested topic: upcoming softfork?

<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:04:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> suggeted topic: do we have sufficient agreement on new chain limts
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:04:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> There were a couple things I wanted to discuss but my mind is blank at the moment.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:05:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Are there other things not yet in the old release branches that we think need to be in the point releases for the softfork?
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:05:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dstadulis&gt;</span> here's the google doc if desired https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t3kGkAUQ-Yui57P29YhDll5WyJuTiGrUhCW8so-E-iQ/edit?usp=sharing
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:05:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> I have a PR open with 0.11 backports
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:05:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> but I plan to add more to it until the freeze
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:06:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> (at which point, I'll backport them to 0.10 too as applicable)
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> is there any coordination in the softfork in regards to other clients? (btcd, bitcoinj, etc)
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:08:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> here
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:08:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> davec (btcd) had previously acked the schedule we'd proposed and IIRC it's ready for it.
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:08:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warren&gt;</span> I could be wrong, but bitcoinj didn't implement all the previous validation rules.
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:08:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> bitcoinj doesn
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> historically bitcoinj has not implemented any softforks.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> bitcoinj doesn't implement any validation rules, afaik
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> I saw a PR for bitcoinj to pay attention to the block versions
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:08:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> well it has the not really maintained validation support.
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:09:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> so what exactly is under consideration: just CLTV?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:09:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> +1 to CLTV alone
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:10:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warren&gt;</span> Also for context, what is on the soft fork wish list for the medium term?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:10:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> I'm not following your question; as you should be aware we'd planned on doing releases with the CLTV soft fork for the 'end of the month'.  No other soft-forks are remotely ready right now.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> (we also discussed this last week)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> i mean, +1 to CLTV alone
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:10:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> that's indeed my assumption, but i want to make sure that's what we're talking about :)
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I think the mediantime backports haven't been merged in the backport branches yet.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:11:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> +1 to CLTV alone, CSV is still just complicated enough it may warrant a more in-depth testing first
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:11:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> mediantime needs standardness first, right?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:11:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> And thats something I wanted to see in (as a standardness only rule of course)
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:12:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> all thats implemented (and merged in master) is the standardness.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:12:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> ok, so that needs backports too
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> are we backporting policy in general, or only future-softfork policies?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:12:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> That was already discussed last week.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:12:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> ok
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:12:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> it's backported at least to 0.11.1 but not merged.
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:12:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:13:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6884 (for 0.11)
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:14:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> (for reference, I'm collecting bugfixes in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6825 )
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> does anyone know the answer to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6825#issuecomment-147972253 ?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:16:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jeremyrubin&gt;</span> that sure looks like a bugfix...
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:16:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> ask petertodd
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:16:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> We're straying offtopic severely now.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> sorry, thought we were falling short on having topics to discuss
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Okay so beyond medianpast some effort needs to go in and pull in any straggling bugfixes, then a RC for a 0.11.2 / 0.10.x update?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:18:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> I'd like to discuss leveldb replacement briefly.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> imo better to keep that topic until there's a viable replacement.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:19:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> We can talk about that subject; but I want to be clear. At this time we are not considering replacing leveldb in Bitcoin core.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> I want to ask if anyone else is making a branch for testing with an alternative.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> (People trying out some other things is great and should always continue.)
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:19:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> I volunteer to make a LMDB branch.  jgarzik already has a sqlite branch.  We need to make tests.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> 32-bit is a big issue
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">leveldb replacement</span>
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:20:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Holy crap.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> LMDB simply doesn't work on 32-bit
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:20:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> stop.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:20:48 </span><span class="nka">* gmaxwell</span> <span class="ac">bangs gavel</span>
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:20:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> Why is 32-bit such a big deal?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:21:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> Want to keep running on raspbery pis?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:21:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I don't think that I was clear enough. We are _NOT_ replacing leveldb at this time. People should happily test other things, the code is abstracted in a way that specifically facilitates that. Have fun, report results.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:21:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> One of my side projects is a from-scratch COW ordered map dbm https://github.com/jgarzik/pgdb2
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> ok, discussion around exploring that seems to be happening now
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:22:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> that is clear, just want to make sure I'm not duplicating someone's effort.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:22:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> The thing that spurred this discussion is a specific bug on windows, which people should stop being shitty developers and fix if they care about and have access to windows. Not run off seeking magic beanstalks.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:23:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> Also having db code in the core and having to maintain it is not really a good idea.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:23:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> seems magic beanstalks don't exist at this point, but people are welcome to look for them :)
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:23:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> I suggest we end the meeting early and discuss any alternative db stuff off-meeting. :P
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:23:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> chain limits?
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:23:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mcelrath:</span> 32-bit is the future~ (maybe)
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">chain limits</span>
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mcelrath:</span> no matter what we use, we will need to maintain it
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:23:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> mostly i want to know what we're looking for to have sufficient consensus to merge them, and maybe i can help try to make that happen, or panic if its not going to
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:23:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> (deferring further discussion on db stuff until post-meeting)
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:23:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> is there any references to data on average chain length in blocks thus far?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:24:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mcelrath&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> would be nice if it had an upstream maintainer and we weren't the only user. (defferring now to post-meeting)
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:24:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> i think some people will be angry, but i dont' see an alternative
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:24:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mcelrath:</span> You misunderstand the purpose of the database in the system. This is not a generic database, but a integral part of the implementation of the consensus algorithim. Some challenge cannot be escaped there.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:24:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> good question!
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB#Bugs_and_Reliability "LevelDB is widely noted for being unreliable and databases it manages are prone to corruption."
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> i posted stats in the pull
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:24:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> link? (haven't got it open)
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:24:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> And if ever something like commited txouts is implemented no off the shelf tool is going to work in any case. So thats just something to get used to there.

<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:26:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jgarzik:</span> Not consistent with our expirence and extensive testing, outside of windows. (I'm familar with the usenix paper, and brought it to our attention when it came out); but among other things our durability requirement is somewhat unusual.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:27:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> oh I missed the chain limits switch.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:27:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> it might be interesting to see the average chain length per block as a graph over time
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:27:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> that will only give us an idea of what was accepted by miners though, and not reflective of the mempool, but, still a good insight?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:27:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> are these numbers on mempool acceptance, or blocks?
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:27:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> i'm not sure average is a good measure?  there were some very long chains during some of the spam attacks
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:27:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> i would expect that actual blocks don't contain many long chains, even if the mempool usually does
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:28:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> overlayed with peak maybe?

<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:28:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> oh is that what you were asking about, longest chain in a block, i didn't measure that
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:29:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> assuming retransmits, all that matters is mempool chains that actually get into a single block
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:29:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> you could also roll the chain window to evaluate over say 3 blocks, assuming the mempool might have been split over that

<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:29:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> that roll check is not very useful, because wallet behavior changes radically at 1 confirm.
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> (suggested next topic: block size replacement with cost limits)
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:30:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jeremyrubin&gt;</span> btw I'm working on some tools for bitcoin anlaysis on top of spark, I imagine they will help at some point with above analysis. Not cam ready near term, but happy to share what I have if anyone needs that kind of thing sooner.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:30:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> E.g. bitcoin core tries _very_ hard to avoid ever creating an unconfirmed chain, but does less avoidance of spends at 1 confirm.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:30:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> indeed, so maybe just average/peak over blockheights, might be worth seeing for insight on limits?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:30:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dstadulis&gt;</span> dcousens why not a histogram?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:31:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dstadulis:</span> I suppose once we have the data, there are various ways we could visualize it :)
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:31:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> ok i can do that i guess.  do you think that puts this to bed
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:31:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> In any case, 25 is very high.  And the recent malleability attacks pretty much would guarentee someone going more than a few deep would be haing a very bad day.
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:32:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> my assumption too is that 25 is very high

<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">19:55:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> not over enforcement in general, AFAIK

<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">19:55:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Yes, I'd be fine with doing something in new files, though I don't know what style we'd use. Going further requires research that no one has done, like getting a determinstic object (which I know for a fact will not just work).
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">19:55:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jgarzik:</span> yes BIP68 and BIP112 implementations
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">19:56:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> seems that gmaxwell for example is opposed to requiring a specific clang-format version; without that, there is no way to do it at all

<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">19:56:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> whats the topic specifically?
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">19:56:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dcousens:</span> no, there is a lot more under determined.
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">19:56:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> my concern about specific versions would be reduced if someone cooked up a way to make setting up an alien clang format (e.g. cfields dep builder work).
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">19:57:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BIP68:</span> i still dislike the fact that the checklocktime function has a clause for skipping missing inputs, under the assumption that those only happen in the wallet
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">19:57:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dcousens&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> ok, well, maybe something for another time then,  I'd like to grab a hard-copy of your concerns if possible though

<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">19:57:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> those behaviours should be separated; i think the function should be pure logic (which takes a list of heights/times, and the different call sites can provide that based on wallet, mempool or chainstate)
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">19:58:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> have you reviewed the latest PRs for #6312?

<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">19:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> ACK, the skipping missing inputs worries me a lot
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">19:58:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> i dived into before and i also agree with sipa
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">19:59:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> it still does that
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">19:59:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> It would be helpful to comment on the PR
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">19:59:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> i've commented multiple times about it
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">20:00:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> mark changed the behaviour to making missing inputs cause failure; i commented that that broke the wallet, and then it was reverted to the preexisting skip behaviour
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">20:00:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> i'd love to get BIP68 and BIP112 merged, but without maaku championing it and being responsible for the code, i think we need to be even more cautious
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">20:01:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> i'm not sure how much responsbility you are taking for it?
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">20:01:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> well it's important to establish what is really needed to get these merged
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">20:01:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> but i think its important that someone takes up the mantle
