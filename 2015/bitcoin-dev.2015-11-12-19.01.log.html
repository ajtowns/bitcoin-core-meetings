<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">19:02:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">What to do about priority for 0.12?  (besides cry)</span>
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">19:02:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> ditch it for now IMO, and work on a more general mechanism to get arbitrary txs propagated (perhaps priority, perhaps hashcash, maybe both!)
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">19:03:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> remove priority entirely
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">19:03:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> wumpus, the wallet needs to be fixed... that is all
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:03:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> So as I commented on sdaftuars #6992, what I care most about is having 0.12 have a nice consistent state
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:03:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> yes, remove all priority is consistent :)
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:03:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> semi-supporting priority in a broken manner is bad
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:03:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> ack on removing enterely, it will be more disruptive the longer we wait
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> we still have the fee adjustment RPC for miners that need to adjust fees, and we can (maybe) use that later to add our own default adjustments if people cry too much, though I'd rather not
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:03:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> well i think pulling priority entirely without ever having warned is too abrupt
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:03:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> I'm ok with that if its politically feasible, but seems like we should have communicated on the -dev list a long time ago and would maybe have gotten some pushback
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:03:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> and we will remove it eventually
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:03:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sdaftuar:</span> agree
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> not that many people use priority, particularly since even right now it's not very reliable and hard to calculate
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:04:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> i proposed a staggered approach in #6992 -- let's let people know we're deprecating, and then plan to pull it in the next release
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> the only people who use priority are devs, pretty much
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:04:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> I dont think we need much time to announce
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:04:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> and in 0.12 we can default the blockprioritysize to 0
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:05:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sdaftuar:</span> well, the upgrade path is itself a staggered approach - not everyone will got to v0.12.0 instantly, and you don't need 100% to propagate reasonably well
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:05:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> we've made the mistake in the past of failing to communicate well that something will not work long term
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:05:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">phantomcircuit:</span> +1
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:05:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> lets not make that mistake again
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:05:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> yes, but that starts with communicate
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:05:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sdaftuar:</span> also, XT will likely keep priority, which gives people an option
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:06:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> morcos, "this is now deprecated" afaict no wallet outside of bitcoin core implements priority calculations
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:06:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> not really an option if you can't pick and choose granularly :)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> action item communicate it on the ml?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:06:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gavinandresen&gt;</span> What’s the plan to mitigate the “spend money on fees, crowd out everybody else’s transactions” attack if priority goes away?
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gavinandresen:</span> that is bitcoin
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:06:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> gavinandresen, there isn't a plan because that's a fundamental property of the system
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:07:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> if someone wants to blow wads of cash on trying to break things they can buy miners just as easily
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:07:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gavinandresen:</span> those attacks are horribly expensive...
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:07:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">phantomcircuit:</span> exactly - as fees pay more of miners' incomes, those attacks become as expensive as just 51% attacking the network anyway
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:07:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gavinandresen&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> really?  I thought the latest spam attack showed it was fairly chieap....
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gavinandresen:</span> yes, but it was also ineffective at stopping normal users from sending txs
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> about all we can do is make it expensive - but economics dictates that sufficiently well-funded adversaries can attack the network
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:08:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gavinandresen:</span> tx fees to get mined quickly never went up that high
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gavinandresen:</span> that's why we have fee estimation, replace-by-fee, CPFP etc.
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:08:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gavinandresen&gt;</span> If the plan is “smarter wallets that raise fees appropriately” then great.  That needs to be communicated.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:08:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gavinandresen:</span> we already have that
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:08:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gavinandresen:</span> wallets already did that
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:08:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> gavinandresen, that is the plan and has been communicated directly to all of the wallet devs for months
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:08:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> that was +/- the only impact the spam attack had
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:08:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> (well, that and the relay network :(((    )
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:08:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> indeed if you open up the google you will find many of them implemented dynamic fees without the last few months
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:09:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> well at least bitcoin core's wallet will need to support that too!
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:09:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> we have the fee estimator stuff?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:09:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> its not bad
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:09:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> AFAIK many of the wallet providers use bitcoin core's fee estimation
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> in fact, many people "implemented dynaic fees" buy just using bitcoin core's
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:10:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> please review #6134 on that note!
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:10:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> hmm, that's good for a baseline, but i would expect that some mechanism to respend with higher fees is available
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:10:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> anyway, back to the actual topic....
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> I think removing priority in 0.12 is fine
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:10:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> ok, will someone volunteer to email -dev and let them know this is the plan then?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> if it is announced in the next weeks
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:10:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> willdo
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">please review #6134 (Improve usage of fee estimation code)</span>
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> that makes some form of RBF a priority
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> mycelium for example has multiple levels of fees that you can easily select
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:11:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> next topic: rbf for 0.12?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:11:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> (though i think the answer there may just be "YES")
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:11:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> then i think we could skip sdaftuar's 6992 and we could skip dynamic priority 6357
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:11:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> (hold on)
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:11:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">RBF:</span> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:11:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> but we'll be having another regression in the mining code, by making those who still want to mine by priority, only have access to starting priority
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:12:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> is that also an ok regression?
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:12:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> we could rip out all priority stuff in 0.12?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:12:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> we should also default block priority size to 0 and comment about further deprecation in the future
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> well, a lot of miners have turned off priority anyway; I'd let them make that decision and give us some feedback
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:12:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> we could backport default block priority size to 0....
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:12:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> but i wouldnt think we should
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:13:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> ... i just wished we could replace priority with an adjusted fee metric...
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:13:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gavinandresen&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> yes, I think that is an OK regression.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> thanks gavinandresen
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> what would that look like?
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:14:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> it ultimately is a balance between rational behavior and how lazy miners are in changing defaults :)
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:14:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> meh, I'm not so sure
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:14:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> why this deprecation needs to be in 2 steps?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:14:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> if we've stopped fully supporting priority, it only makes sense to change the default blockpriority size to 0, doesn't need to be backported
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:14:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> ack
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:14:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> i said i wished; i'm not convinced it is possible in a useful way
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jtimon:</span> primarily bc it hasn't be discussed very much yet
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:15:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> we could have something for relay that isnt the same as mining (years ago there was some discussion of "relay policy is what *you* want to be mined", miners can do the rational thing)
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:15:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jtimon:</span> to give some advance warning before completely removing it
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:15:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> ok, well then I agree
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:15:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> I believe this has been a recurring discussion ever since we wanted to limit the mempool size
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:15:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> anyway, i think the new 2 step process avoids adding new complication now.  presents a mostly consistent release, and allows us to rip all this stuff right out as soon as we branch off 0.12
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:15:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jtimon:</span> but it has only been a discussion among developers
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:15:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> well, if we're not *ready* to rip that code away, I 100% agree we should just set the default to zero, but if we're ready to rip that code away, I see no reason to delay
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:16:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> ok, default to zero as a first step and remove in 0.13 ?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:16:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> we should absolutely not remove priority..
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:17:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:17:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> why?
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:17:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> it's the best metric Core's default policy supports right now..
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:17:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> no, feerate is
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:17:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I thought sipa has a good way to rationalize it that should be exploired. It would eliminate the multiple objective optimization.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jg_taxi&gt;</span> Nearly universal  consensus to remove - except for Luke :)
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:17:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> feerate often isn't.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> morcos, we should not be carrying code complex efficient dynamic priority calculation
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:18:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> multiple objective optimization isn't that hard
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> yes, we should explore adjustments to feerate, but the priority code as it exists should be ripped out
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> we should only have a cost function (currently txSize) and a reward function (currently fees)
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:18:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">phantomcircuit:</span> right, we will skip adding that
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:18:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> i rewrote that sentence one time too few
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> not fundimentally hard but unnecessary code and computional complexity.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:18:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> I think what we need is "multi-mempool" support, to make it easier to deal with multiple different metrics - e.g. a pool with polcies like Eligius certainly would want to have an easy time setting up a seperate priority-based mechanism
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:18:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> also shouldn't be changing defaults to try to influence miners, outside of emergencies.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:18:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> after we unify that it's much simpler to change the cost/reward functions
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jg_taxi&gt;</span> Fee deltas can produce priority
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> same reason I think we *should* have a non-feerate mechanism for tx propagation that doesn't interact with the feerate based mechanism
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jg_taxi:</span> yup
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:19:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> the thing sipa suggests eliminates all impact of priority except in the cost calculation.
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:19:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> we're not chaning to try to influence miners, we're changing to keep shit from breaking when miners disable priority anyway
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:19:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> what i'm proposing is basically shipping 0.12 as is with respect to priority, with a couple of changes: mining code will use starting priority, default prioritysize=0, and wallet is smart enough to not place priority txs if mempool limiting is in effect
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:19:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jg_taxi&gt;</span> Thus you can do priority without priority code
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:19:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> which seems reasonable
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:19:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> so thats the fewest changes from now to a semi-consistent state.   more ripping out can then be done in 0.13.   if we're not going to rip it out, we should do more now to make it work better, but sounds like we are
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:20:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jg_taxi&gt;</span> Ack 0
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:20:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> though I really want to rip out the code (its a big churn, though, so we can push back)
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:20:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> I'd be inclined to make the wallet not use priority at all by default
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">19:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> the first should be optional, at least
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">19:20:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> jg_taxi, gmaxwell: my idea was to take the btcdaysdestroued of a transaction, divide that by the average utxo age, take a small fraction of that (1%) and add that as extra fee
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">19:20:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> I don't know what you mean. Why would things break?
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">19:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> jg_taxi, gmaxwell: the problem is that that has no bound on how much fees can be lost by a miner
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">19:21:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> and why must default policy be changed to prevent it?
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">19:21:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> main thing is I just don't want users to get their txs stuck, especially since full RBF and CPFP support isn't in the wallet yte
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">19:21:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> ok i agree with petertodd , lets default QT to no longer send free also.  bitcoind already has that off
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">19:21:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> multiple sorting orders is a massive complication to maintain...

<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">19:22:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jg_taxi&gt;</span> Once opt in RBF is there wallet will have smarter policies in this area
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">19:22:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> better to maintain complicated code than to make flexible policy code more complicated to write
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">19:22:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> petertodd, how do you relay transactions that you're not keeping in the mempool though?
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:22:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> (especially if there's opt in RBF for them)
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:22:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> you can simply cap the impact; thats a candidate for the only tunable for that approach.
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">19:22:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">phantomcircuit:</span> well, I'm thinking in the future we won't just have one mempool, or one way fo relaying - e.g. it'd be a trivial hack to do tx relaying by bitmessage :)
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:23:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> From a code perspective what sipa suggests is largely orthorgonal with removing priority (actually, it wants priority removed); but from a communication perspective it's different.
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">19:23:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> that does mean it should work first...
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">19:23:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> The problem is its impossible to meaningfully speed up CreateNewBlock unless you are A) dynamically calculating priority on the fly as in 6357 or B) changing to a static definition of priority.
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:23:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> if simpler mempool code, makes it harder to write mining policy code, then the simpler mempool policy code should be rejected.
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:23:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> I'm really not sold on doing an adjustment metric....I mean we could, as long as it has a limited impact and I'd be fine with that, but then what was the point?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:24:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> I really think we need the performance improvement in CNB, so we have to pick A or B.  People don't like adding the complication of A, so B it is
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:24:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> mostly I think we should only do it for relay, not mining, but then there is actually no point
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:24:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jg_taxi&gt;</span> It sounds like there needs to be a minor hook related to this anyway
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:24:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> luke's argument as I understand it is that in recent months we'd generally seen dos attackers as more willing and able to pay just over market rate fees than joe user; even though many wallets have caught up with dynamic fee behavior. Part of this is due to the market rate fees being so low that most of the cost of adjustment is the lack of RBF (which doesn't bother attackers) rather than the fee its
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:24:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> you don't have to remove priority in your branch
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:24:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> elf.  But all this may be a temporary effect.
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:24:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> or recalculate priorities each block
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:24:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jtimon:</span> the changes being proposed make that impossible

<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:24:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> not impossible, just expensive

<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:25:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> even a limited impact is likely useful for getting non-dos-attack transactions sorted higher.
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:25:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> there is a fee-adjustment api for this, it can be tweaked into being your priority calculator

<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> sure, but do we get miners to use it as well?
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> the speed at which wallet authors have adopted dynamic fees makes me pretty optimistic that dos attackers won't be doing too much harm - the cost to pay over "market rate" is really, really high
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:25:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> priority is not fee-adjustment.
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:26:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gavinandresen&gt;</span> +1 for using the adjust api if you want something weird. And I vote for simple and fast for createnewblock
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:26:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phantomcircuit&gt;</span> this all fundamentally comes down to a simple question; do you believe that user real users will pay higher fees than non-users?
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:26:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">phantomcircuit:</span> that overly simplifies.

<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">19:46:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> we should definitely communicate the RBF sendmany alternative to long chains ASAP
<a name="l-366"></a><span class="tm">19:46:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> if people were justnusing payment protocol etc, and not using the p2p network as a communication channel, nobody would care
<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">19:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> ok after it's merged I will email the list
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">19:46:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">19:46:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> agreed
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">19:46:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> the cases people raised were all for small chain counts; and large chains cannot be safely supported by the software (of course you can still author large chains, you just need to retransmit until nodes take them-- not unlike other limits... not even clear to me that people knew this)
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">19:47:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> read my conversation with petertodd above
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">19:47:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Long chains are still also highly malleability vulnerable.
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">19:47:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">re:</span> "customer sees tx in wallet" - the user experience of long chains isn't great anyway, as they're not all that reliable due to propagation failures
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">19:47:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">19:47:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> retransmit doesn't work for them, it is not mining; it is about getting them instantly relayed
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">19:47:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">19:47:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> fair point though also petertodd's response.
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">19:48:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> RBF sendmany won't show up in many users wallets yet :(
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">19:48:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> get opt-in RBF into tree, and it will show up in wallets rapidly.
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">19:48:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> I think this is the reason to announce this as far in advance as possible
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">19:48:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jgarzik:</span> agreed
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">19:48:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> I think showing up in wallets isn't the actual metric, showing up in block explorers is.
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">19:48:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> So that if they need to figure out another way to communicate the information they can
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">19:48:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jgarzik:</span> +!
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">19:49:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> also its a configurable limit!, we're just chanigng the default
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">19:49:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> good point - although it'll take awhile for even that to be handled well rather than as scary doublespends
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">19:49:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> morcos, agree but weak argument - most go with default
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">19:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> yes it's not a consensus change :)
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">19:49:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> we can contact popular explorers to make changes. Shouldnt be hard.
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">19:49:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> indeed; defaults has anlot.of power unfortunately
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">19:49:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> the default should be one that allows the node to operate securely and be safe from attack, if more risky parameters are needed for rarer use cases that should be something those users worry about
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">19:49:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> In any case I think collectively we dont think failing to limit here is technically viable. So what choice do we have? people can have their own opinions, but not your own reality. :)

<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">19:50:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> agreed - first priority is to keep the system working for the super majority who don't need long chains
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">19:50:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> gmaxwell, yep -- and merging is the best way to get user feedback on that, IMO
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">19:50:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> that's true - the only thing under discussion is what the limits should be, not whetehr there should be any
