<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">19:01:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> ok, any topics?
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">19:01:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> suggested topic: priority clarification

<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">19:01:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> suggested topic: dealing with mempool eviction
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">19:02:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> so it wasn't entirely clear to me after last weekend what the plan was wrt priority
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:02:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> but imho, either we stop supporting it for tx creation entirely (meaning estimatepriority etc go away)
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:02:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> or it keeps working
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:03:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> which also means a mempool area for priority, or there's no way to keep wallet-created priority transactions in
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:03:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> i am ok with either.  i vote for stop supporting it for tx creation entirely.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:04:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> i feel like we will keep going round and round on this issue release after release unless we finally start pulling off the bandaid
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:04:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> if we develop a better framework for supporting a similar type metric we can add it back
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:04:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> but we waste too much time debating it.
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> action point for that for last week re: priority was to look at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6134
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:05:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> it sounded like luke-jr was the only one opposed to ceasing support for it
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> he's also the person that introduced the priority deltas IIRC
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> we should pull the bandaid now imo
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> yes #6134 is required either way.  if we decide to start including priority support, we can make a simple modification to that pull to return the estimate maxed with mempools min priority instead of infinity
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:06:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> i think other people (including myself) think the notion has some benefit
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:07:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> but its a matter of introducing additional complicatin at this point to continue supportin git
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:08:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I've decided to stop disliking the complete removal of priority.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:08:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> I won't insist on this, but everything (including 6134) would just be simpler without having to worry about the priority code
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> I never really liked it in the first place
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> yay!
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> yay!
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:09:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> do it
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> iirc Luke-Jr wasn't so happy about removing it, but not now nor eventually
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:09:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> we have fee deltas that work in the same way, though
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes, we can still support a similar delta
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:10:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> i'd still like to try adding a "count very small fraction of bitcoin-days-destroyed as extra fee"
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> txfee rate delta
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:10:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> If this is the path we follow (which I agree with), then I would suggest for the mining code we use the lowerBoundPriority concept from 7008 for 0.12.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> fee delta
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:11:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">clarification:</span> I never really liked the priority code - I only disliked removing it because it was too tangled up
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:11:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> sounds good to me
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:11:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> I think we can only do that if there is a very low cap
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:11:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> at which point its useless
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:11:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> so....why?
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:11:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> i know
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> i said try
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> fair enough
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:12:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> ok - next topic?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> I will discourage all miners from upgrading if priority is removed.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:12:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> so do we actually need to modify 6134?  i think it's fine in it's current form.  we -could- take out futher priority support, but i think it works pretty well as is.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:12:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> suggested topic: merge #6312 sequence numbers
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:12:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> it's not removed from mining, only from the wallet
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:12:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> ok
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:13:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> though you'll need a sufficiently large mempool to keep priority txn in
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:13:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> that seems acceptable, since nobody is really maintaining the wallet
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sdaftuar:</span> I think if we remove priority from other tx creation places it'll be equivalently easy to move in from 6134
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:13:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> i'd merge 6134 first (after it gets reviewed) and then let people remove priority
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:13:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> but 6134 has important fee estimation changes
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:13:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> ok that makes sense to me
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:14:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> my offer to help adapting any codebase to a non-priority future still stands (even/spcially if you think that case it's "impossible")
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:14:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> suggested topic: dealing with evicted wallet transactions
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:14:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> I don't dislike that "count as extra fee", though I think morcos convinced me that it won't make the big improvement I thought it would. (and if we were going to bias a bit it could be utxo destroyed)
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> i thought this was always the plan?

<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:16:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">so:</span> problem: currently when a wallet transaction is evicted, the wallet considers the resulting transaction as "conflicting" and will happily respend the inputs
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:16:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> add a timeout, done
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:16:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> We knew when we added the conflicting stuff using the mempool that it would be problematic later. (I checked logs)
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:16:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> suggested solution: only when accepttomemorypool fails due to non-existing inputs does the wallet treat the result as conflicting
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:16:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> makes the wallet shitty, but we need rbf
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:16:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I think that's the wrong behavior, it shouldn't automatically regard transactions that you created yourself as respendable
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:17:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> it should consider it respendable at some point later on, though
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> what's the definition of an evicted tx?
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:17:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> the wallet code needs to understand when transactions are *actually* conflicted
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:17:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> fix that and the rest just works
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:17:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> just add a way to manually remove transactions if the user doesn't care aout it anymore
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:17:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> + add a removewallettransaction function (GUI/RPC) which removes unconfirmed transactions (the GUI version can warn if it's still in the mempool at that point)
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> that corresponds exactly (afaik) to failing with missing inputs
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> the 'remove' should perhaps not remove but tag as removed. I am uncomfortable with anything that destroys records.
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> that would be good, too, but I don't like anything involving a timeout
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> That will be a big usability improvement for Bitcoin Core users...
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jgarzik&gt;</span> rename if not remove
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:18:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">removewallettransaction:</span> tag as removed and remove it withing the next x hours when no confirmation come in?

<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:18:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> I agree, a timeout would not fix the logic here. And even if we added a timeout, we would still need to fix the logic.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:18:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> well as long as it's no longer visible
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:18:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> any reason to remove vs move to another list?

<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:19:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> archive would be fine.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:19:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> rather than remove, maybe have a atomic thing to force acceptance of a double-spend?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:19:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> as long as it's *effectively* removed

<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:19:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> remove could give the impression the tx can't be mined in the future...
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I mean people use -zapwallettxes now, this deletes all unconfirmed transactions
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:19:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> maybe we need something separate that just marks a tx as respendable
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:19:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> if we don't have a "is this transaction conflicted" function, it probably isn't hard to write one..
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:20:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> yes, archive then, and effectively removes it.   I'm concerned that either will be seen as canceled but we could allow archival only once confirmed or conflicted?
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:20:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> might be more expensive though, if we're not careful
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:20:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> lets perhaps not do design in the meeting (/me guilty look)
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:20:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> should we agree on adding a function (RPC/GUI) that can remove/archive an transaction? specs. done later?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:20:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> yeah, like an opt-in RBF or something but for non-respendable transactions...
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:21:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> well the important part is being able to mark a transaction as respendable
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> whether that also archives/deletes/hides... is extra functionality
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:21:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> giveupontx
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> yeah, sorry the important part is to free the inputs
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:22:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> freeinputstransaction ?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:22:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> bleh
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:22:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> indeed, it shouldn't be silent because you may need to resend the payment.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:22:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> archive sounded fine to me.
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:22:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jtimon:</span> free is way too overloaded for this space :)
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:22:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> bitcoin wallet for android has a "respend with higher fee" function
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:22:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> i think
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:22:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> fair enough
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:23:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> also archiving transactions could (eventually) improve performance of listtransactions and such.
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> that would be a nice feature regardless of removal
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I would like an option to just forget about a transaction completely - but yes, that's unrelated to the mempool eviction thing
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:23:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> but we need a minimal viable idea for 0.12 (as morcos said)
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:23:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> yeah respendtransaction seems cooler than archivetransaction
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:24:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> minimum viable idea IMO is to fix the "isconflicted" method
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:24:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;</span> whatever we do otherwise, we still need that fixed
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:24:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> do we have other topics (we can discuss this more later.   I think minimum viable is what sipa suggests.
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:24:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Luke-Jr:</span> that means you still get coins that may be locked up for infinity
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> that we detect conflict instead of non-mempooling.
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:25:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> but archivetransaction and then spend seems equivalent (assuming you can chose one of the inputs from the archived transaction)

<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:35:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CodeShark:</span> well thats the point, its fine to go forward with residual gripes but we should know that we are and do so intentionally.
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:36:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> well, even as unused code I think would simplify things, but I still don't see the "wait for bip113 to be widely used to merge bip68 as a policy thing in master"
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:36:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> we need the backports for consensus, not for policy

<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:37:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Seperate concerns, we should not isstandard enforce unless we're reasonably confident the protocol design will not change.

<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">19:38:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jtimon:</span> which are nonstandard
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">19:38:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Okay so I think we should try to see if we can find any gripes, and move towards merging, and turn on as standard after next meeting if the gripes we can find are not convincing at all.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">19:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> but what is exactly the harm if it gets merged before bip113 is widely used?

<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">19:41:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> the code appears to have the 512 seconds

<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">19:49:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> where does that number come from
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">19:49:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> my numbers, i don't know.... i'm quickly skimming the code now, probably not the best use of everyones time
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">19:49:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> no, i'm looking at the code
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">19:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> yeah thats why we need a BIP
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">19:50:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> anyhow, so the code and BIP looked to be good at, it's certainly not ready yet
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">19:50:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> there was a long conversation months about about conserving as many bits in nsequence as possible
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">19:50:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> right but the conserved bits are kind of all over the place now

<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">19:50:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> no I disagree. the code is ready, the BIP needs to be syncronised. It wont take an hour
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">19:50:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> which might be ok, but it needs to be clearly described
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">19:51:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> this has to be NACK for 0.12.  this is crazy

<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">19:51:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> sorry, I disagree. You are making a big fuss over an administration error
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">19:51:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> we have to agreed on the design specification first.  some people maybe think they were agreeing on the BIP and soe think they were agreein gon the code
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">19:51:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> in any case, we really can't merge without the bip being believed consistent-- I agree.
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">19:51:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> i agree i'm making a big fuss :)
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">19:51:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morcos:</span> we already agreed the design specification.

<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">19:52:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> and other people only read the code.
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:52:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> i'm not blaming anyone btw... we all want this functionality merged.  and you're the only one thats even stepping up to the plate at all, so don't get me wrong

<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">19:52:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> and other people don't know what they agreed to. Which is part of why I was suggesting another round of gripe gathering, but that can't happen unless we think the code and bip agree.
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:52:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> but i think we have to be a little bit more careful with this stuff
