<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">19:00:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> proposed topic: core internal binary signing and verification tool
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">19:00:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kanzure:</span> its twitter handle is therealping
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">19:00:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kanzure:</span> it comes from gmaxwell, who the offical meeting-pinger, and he is authenticated with freenode
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">19:01:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> how do we know freenode is still free?
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">19:01:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> because otherwise it would be renamed to restrictednode
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:01:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> a tool would be nice, but there is no reason for it to be internal
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:01:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> there are
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:01:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> (to be covered under gitian)
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:01:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">core internal binary signing and verification tool</span>
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:02:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> you can gitian-build things besides Bitcoin
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:02:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> I propose to add to cli tools to the bitcoin-core package
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:02:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> off-topic, but does anyone know the status of deterministic debian efforts?
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:02:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> bitcoin-core-verify and bitcoin-core-sign
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:02:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> The later will not be shipped
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:02:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> bitcoin-core-verify &lt;folder-or-file&gt; -&gt; 1) hashes file(s) 2) download gitian assets files together with ECDSA sigs 3) verify hashed against downloaded assets files 4) verify assets ECDSA sigs against in-binary-pubkeys (dev-name/pubkey)
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:02:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> bitcoin-core-verify will list valid signatues of devs by listing devs name.
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:02:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I suppose it will be a separate executable within the bitcoin core distribution, other software can also include it if they want, but that's not initially very important
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:02:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> jonasschnelli I think it needs to be GUI for wider adoption.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:03:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes. It would be a Qt tool for one major reason
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:03:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Please don't do design in the meeting.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:03:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> https downloads
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:03:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> okay. fair enought...
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:03:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I'm planning on having someone work on that.
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:03:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> jonas is already building something afaik
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:03:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes it needs https support to get at the signatures from github
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:03:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes. But happy to pause.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:04:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> If it does https I will nak it so hard keys will fall  of the keyboard.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Qt would have https support built in
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:04:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> the gitian sigs come over https
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:04:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> We _cannot_ ship some downloading tool that is going to require frequent CVEs itself.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:04:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> it's not a downloading tool
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:04:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> either with git or with https
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;MarcoFalke&gt;</span> So how do you verify bitcoin-core-verify?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:04:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> just a verification tool
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">MarcoFalke:</span> it'd be part of the distribution
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:04:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> no need for https when you have cryptographic verification
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:04:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> What btcdrak said.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:04:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> I guess even if https is broken, nobody can upload valid EC sigs
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:05:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> https _is_ broken
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:05:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> https is required to download from github I guess
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:05:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> well if you can get information from github through http that would work too
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:05:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes. TLS is not required for security.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> the git protocol isn't encrypted I think
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:05:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> actually I think it's impossible to fetch from github without https, you'd have to use the git:// ptrotocol
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> you seriously wouldn't want to implement the git protocol
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> distribution == our release? Or OS?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:06:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> he. yes. no git:// please
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:06:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cfields:</span> yes, our releases
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> The only concern is – and this is why i borugh it up – the ec-pubkeys together with dev-name should be placed in bitcoin/bitcoin
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:06:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> otherwise you'd have to host the signatures somewhere else than github, which is possible of course, but is a change in the release process
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:06:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> somewhere where it could be used in cpp source code (probably in a header)
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:07:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> well the gpg keys are already in the respository
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:07:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> this would allow to build a "trusted-chain" of bitcoin-core binaries
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:07:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> mm. Can we back up then and address what this is aiming to solve? What protects against someone re-packaging a malicious release along with a clone "verification tool" that always passes?
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:07:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> an email to the mailing list about verification procedures seems prudent at some point, as a general reminder. i'm sure there's existing content somewhere that can be copied for these purposes.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:07:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cfields:</span> Sure. Thats always possible
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:07:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> just confirmed github forces https redirection
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;MarcoFalke&gt;</span> So bitcoin-core-verify checks the release, but is part of the release... Isn't this circular?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cfields:</span> yes, it only works for chaining, if the first link in the chain is broken it solves nothing...
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:08:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> But not if you have verified the first download (assume with gitian verify), then verify with the new tool
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:08:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cfields:</span> well if something competent were being done, the setup would be the last version you got provides a tool to get/verify the next version.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:08:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">MarcoFalke:</span> it'd be used to check the *next* release downloaded
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:08:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> bikeshedding for a sec, but "next" seems important enough to be part of the name ;)
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:08:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> people could still gitian-verify our new verification tool
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:08:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">MarcoFalke:</span> having it verify itself would be sillly
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:08:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> right.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cfields:</span> so if you previously got a good release, then you'll have good releases foreverafter (or at least until the signing keys were compromised :) )
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;MarcoFalke&gt;</span> ok, I see
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> s/compromised/revoked?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:09:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> +revoked, at least?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kanzure:</span> +1. that wasn't clear to me until now :)
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> key revoking is possible over our release-management
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:09:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kanzure:</span> well it be N-out-of-M ,so could tolerate some revoked or compromised keys Iguess..
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kanzure:</span> without an uncensorable communications medium or expiration there is no sense for revocation.
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> hm.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:09:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> then they'd just be removed in the next release
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:09:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> I just wanted to hear if it's ackable to continue to work on this... if so, I'll come up with something for 0.14.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:10:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> n of m is close to an uncensorable communicatoins medium subject to an honest threshold assumption.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:10:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> well, if you're looking at the list of people/keys who *didn't* sign, it might help to know they revoked their key rater than simply didn't-sign
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:10:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> what if you got a good release, but were later infected with malware which changed the verifier tool?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> oh well.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:10:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> if you are infected, it's end of story really
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:10:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> it can already steal your coins
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:10:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> indeed
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:10:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> if you're infected with malware you're hosed at that point.
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:10:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> you are eaten by a frue
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:11:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> *grue
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> you can't protect from malware on that layer
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:11:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> perhaps the malware would be kind enough to at least inform you of your infection
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:11:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> that's another story entirely (hardaware wallets / security modules)
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:11:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> impossible
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> At least, the EC binary sig tool would allow hardware wallets to sign the binaries
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> that's an interesting idea
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:12:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> (though you can do this with GPG smartcard)
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> there are smartcards running GPG?
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> is there some micro-gpg implementation?
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> but a big mess
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> A number of people around here use gpg via yubikey3.
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yeah...
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:12:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> petertodd has one with pin entry. sounds like he's at the cash register when sending emails
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:12:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> it's not really gpg on the smartcard, it's a rsa signer on a stick. :)
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:13:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> Ledger Nano S could be programmed to do signing. It also has a GPG module coming. It uses an ST31 secure element afaik
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> oh right, just the rsa signing, the ugly thing about gpg is all the packet parsing and interpretation etc
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> btcdrak, I have a pgp key from mine
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:14:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> (just playing around with it)
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:14:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> There is a terrible complex standard for supporting it. In any case, it's a good thing to have.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:14:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> same problem as TLS really, the crypto algorithms themselves are reasonably elegant and bug-free, but all the parsing mess around it...
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:14:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> should we move on?
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:14:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> anyhow, I think we agree that we'd want to use secp256k1 signatures
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> if we can agree on one thing
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:15:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> Just a separate note, I think everyone here should be using some kind of smartcard/hardware device for GPG signing. There are plenty inexpensive options like Yubikeys and etc.
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:15:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Okay. I'll work on a short design and post it to bitcoin-core-dev ML
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> I just use old computers, but I agree that's the more practical option :-)
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:15:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> should we be complaining about hkp to the bitcoin.org people?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:15:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> can you spend some time and talk to mr or sipa before you post?
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> Yes. Will do... thanks for offering that.

<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">19:41:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Keep in mind the behavior you're seeing would potentially cause a consensus divergence if it happened to miners. It is a high criticality issue unless we know conditions that reduce its risk.

<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">19:42:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> firefox has a completely different situation
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">19:42:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> My impression is that we haven't really suffered any delay for 0.13 related to the general size. The rcs have not been horribly buggy or anything.

<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">19:43:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> so i would vote we schedule 0.14 as soon as 0.13.0 is out

<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">19:45:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes. This seems to follow most agile development practices.

<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">19:59:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> let's not have a new thing creep into SW every week though :p

<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">19:59:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> ?
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">19:59:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> though not against a separate sf that is also in 0.13.1, though thats also gross
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">20:00:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> it's a trivial one liner (modulo tests)
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">20:00:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> the only reason to bundle IMO is if we want to add new non-VERIFY opcodes to segwit.
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">20:00:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> I'm aware, doesnt mean I like it
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">20:00:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> we discussed that last week BlueMatt, the disadvantage of not bundling is that no one would care about a separete softfork for them
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">20:00:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> they're just a cleanup
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">20:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> but LOWS/NULLDUMMY are just softforks, so no need to bundle IMO
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">20:00:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> (no harm either)
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">20:00:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> ok, fair enough, though in same version...anyway, I'll hold my tounge
