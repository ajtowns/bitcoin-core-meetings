<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:07:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> so the main issue is #8279
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:07:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> 213 seeds in non-good state (probably just set up)

<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> there are a lot more parties running it than accepting inbound, as typical.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:08:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> and there have been several proposed solutions, including: verify all inputs (even if the transaction is too big or below feerate), not entering failed witness txn into the reject table, making feefilter mandatory, ...
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8279
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:08:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> I think all of these changes are beneficial.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:08:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> this is separate from the malleability confusion someone posted about the other day, ya?
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:09:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> making feefilter mandatory, or merely always using it?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:09:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> kanzure, the linked github issue explains it
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:09:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> you need to be able to rely on it, and be able to ban peers who disregard it
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> me means giving it an ack message and punting peers that violate it.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:10:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> as you're moving the responsibility for filtering things you won't accept to the sender
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> ok, so &lt;0.12 nodes wouldn't be kicked
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:10:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> right.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> segwit is a good opportunity to make feefilter mandatory, given we're completely changing what nodes we connect too
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:10:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> <span class="hi">instagibbs:</span> for example; someone was unaware that adding witness data to a non-segwit script was consensus-invalid.  but er, your link seems more productive anyway, so nevermind.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:11:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> i think that is the plan
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:11:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> yes, but it seems hasty to do that along with 0.13.1
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> in any case, "verify all inputs" was a proposal from before segwit was even imagined.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:12:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> sure, but 0.13.1 also "hastily" has to stop fetching stuff from non-segwit nodes
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:12:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> by hasty i mean we haven't implemented/tested/... a mandatory feefilter yet
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:12:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> we have tested the relay behaviour of segwit vs non-segwit peers
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I believe the primary reason we didn't just make the verify all inputs change is that it was proposed before feefilter, during spam attacks, and there was a lot of rejected stuff coming from even cooperative peers. That should be resolving now.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:13:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> but thats the thing, you can just make it mandatory if the peer is a segwit peer, and leave the current behavior the same otherwise - non-segwit peers can't send us segwit txs at all (other than ones stripped of their witnesses which is easy to detect)
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:13:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> we still need a new network message etc
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> otherwise peers can just ignore your feefilter
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:14:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> maybe I'm missing something, but why do we need a new network message?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> I think petertodd is saying "segwit peers MUST NOT ignore feefilter"
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:14:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> because the protocol is async, we don't know if the far end has recieved our feefilter request yet.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:14:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> you don't know what the last feefilter message you sent is that your peer received
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:15:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> ah right, duh...
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:15:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> so you send a feefilter, remote sends an inv.. you get the data.. oops failed filter.. Was the far end bad or just too fast?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:15:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> so the suggestion there is to add a feefilterack, and punt peers that should send it but don't send it 'fast enough'
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> I had it in my head that feefilter worked the other way around, and already had a new inv with fee info...
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> are there any possible nodes where implementing feefilter would be a burden? I think we already need fee info to relay transactions anyway, right?
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:16:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> yes, thats part of the consideration.
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> i expect that most of the problems are solved with just having feefilter
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> and we can just do #8525 now
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:17:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> hm, what if we change feerate's definition and want to get rid of the current algo some day?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> (don't store witness txn in the reject cache)
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I think we should be able to always validate now that feefilter is in place. The only argument I recall against always validating is that that a significant fraction of all recieved txn failed the fee check. That should be much less true now.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8525
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:18:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> that could be a problem in the future if we have peers with different non-fee-related acceptance criteria than us
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:18:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> I kinda like the idea of an inv with fee data - slightly larger messages but no need for state
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:18:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> reject cache was 90% implemented for lack of a fee filter.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:18:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> that would open up many attacks... i don't think those are impossible to fix, but it needs a lot of analysis
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:18:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I disagree.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:19:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> i like the idea of always validating (as #8593 does), but it feels risky
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:19:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> An uncached UTXO lookup eclipses the validation costs on most systems by orders of magnitude.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:19:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> yeah, I don't see how an attacker who can DoS attack by sending specially crafted txs is ever stopped by the other validation rules, and yes, UTXO looking is expensive too
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> can't we consider extreme cases?
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> what's the maximum possible validation cost for a single transaction?
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:21:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> huge... remember we can't have any feerate or size based rejection criteria beforehand
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:21:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> well you can have a stripped size limit.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:21:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> yes, #8593 does that
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:21:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> but you can't use fee
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:22:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> or at least not actual feerate, only stripped-size-feerate
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:22:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> I'm not sure if this is what petertodd was referring to above - but I was imagining an inv that sends not just transaction hash - it also sends fee amount and tx size
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:23:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> so, an attacker who was trying to DoS attack you would just pay enough fee, with a tx that triggered O(n^2) complexity
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:23:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> so I don't see the value of feerate in preventing DoS attack there anyway
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:23:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> an attacker can now craft a very expensive valid transaction that has a feerate too low to be acceptable to you, but stripped-size-feerate high enough
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:23:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> and you'll validate it, but not relay
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:24:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CodeShark:</span> improved invs are a fine thing, longer term (though we should be spending our time on reconcillation, IMO) -- but I think the focus of the discussion is on shorter term since we likely need some improvements for 0.13.
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:24:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> right, but relaying is worse! we're then attacking others, and there's still no guarantee the tx will get mined, allowing the attacker to doublespend and repeat
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:25:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> well in no case will any of this relay
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> An alternative jl2012 suggested to validating all was to randomly validate some percentage. This will allow you to punt a peer sending you garbage, but you only take a fraction of the cost.
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:26:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> it seems simpler to just create a new static inv structure than to have to manage session states and do feefilteracks and stuff like that
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:26:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> sure, so then why not kick peers that send us DoS attack txs? IsStandard() has been around long enough that we could get away with that
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:27:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CodeShark:</span> i think mandatory feefilter is a better solution than adding 10 kB of data to each inv
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CodeShark:</span> not so, right now inv bandwidth is already _greater_ than transaction bandwidth. You can't really escape the need to have people not send you things you're totally disinterested in.
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:28:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> 10kB of data?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:28:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> the fee is uint64 and the tx size is varint
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:28:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CodeShark:</span> txid, wtxid, fee, feerate, stripped feerate, size, sigops, bytes hashed, ... anything else that may affect your policy
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:28:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> ok, fair enough
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:28:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> inv bandwidth is larger than tx bandwidth by a factor of 5 on my node

<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:41:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields_&gt;</span> oh, i suppose that's why you want to know about sig type :)

<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">19:43:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields_&gt;</span> and apple adds a weird little scripting language around 'designated requirements'

<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">19:43:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cfields_:</span> well there could be several signers, and we get a cert for the combined key?
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">19:43:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> The question is, does code-signing really increases the security of bitcoin-core...
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">19:44:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields_&gt;</span> so you can add other restrictions, but again, i'm not sure how much apple lets you deviate from the default
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">19:44:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> imagine where common gitian builders all sign themselves and combine the sig
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:44:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> the straightforward way of doing threshold RSA needs a trusted dealer. but at least its multiparty after setup.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">19:44:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> I suspect the code-signature-verification is what increases the security of bitcoin-core :)
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">19:44:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> i rather say verifing of gitian signatures...
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">19:44:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> essentially we'd get the OS to verify the gitian builds in this case
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">19:44:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> yes and no. the code-signing itself, not really. but code-signing does allow you to force-on the osx sandbox, which is interesting for security
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">19:44:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> OSX code signatures are from "Bitcoin Foundation"... anyone could hold the key
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">19:45:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> i'm sure we can get a new cert
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">19:45:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> the gitian signatures aren't ever going to be much more secure than the code signatures

<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">19:45:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> and sandboxing is impossible for bitcoin core right now
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">19:45:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> also, lots of people don't use the gitian builds (I've never personally run one)
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">19:45:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> We can get a new cert and we should improve the maintaince of it so no one person needs to hold the key-- it's a good practice.
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">19:45:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> someone should make sure to watch petertodd do a gitian build in milan :)

<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">19:51:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Which would allow decoupling the keys from the wallet(system)
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">19:51:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jeremyrubin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kanzure:</span> nope; i tried changing the travis script to dump them but couldn't see anything.
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">19:52:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> you can probably call gdb bt from inside the after_failure segment
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">19:52:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> to end the wild-west APIs/interfaces that are currently been implemented by wallets and hardware-wallet vendors
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">19:52:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I very much like the idea of standardizing detached signing
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">19:52:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes, exactly
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">19:52:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> One of the main problems users have and will have with wallets is to keep private keys private.
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">19:53:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> it makes no sense to try to support detached signing in bitcoin core until there is some kind of standard, if every hw vendor is going to hook in their own code in their own way it isgoing to be a mess
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">19:53:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> well you'd hope hardware signing devices will become more commonplace
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">19:53:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> they will
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">19:54:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> 7 minutes, any more topics?
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">19:54:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CodeShark&gt;</span> it's not something we should hope for - it's something we should make happen
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">19:54:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> no doubt about that, though it's two-sided, software also needs to support them
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">19:54:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes. I proposed the URLScheme standard... even, I don't like it in the first place.. but its probably the only choice if we'd like to address all systems and platforms.
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">19:54:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CodeShark:</span> jonasschnelli is helping make it happen
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">19:54:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> the topic is still codesigning :)
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">19:54:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> also note that in systems like Qubes, detached signing in another VM is a significant security improvement even w/o special hardware
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">19:54:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> yes. detached signing is more for the bitcoin-dev ML
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">19:54:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">btcdrak:</span> Qubes does this for GPG already
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">19:55:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> I think at this point the discussion should stop and some prototypes should be tried. You've seen there is some support and some opposition, and thats fine.
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">19:55:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> do we still have anything to say about codesigning?
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">19:55:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;btcdrak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> interesting
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">19:55:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> Yes. I'm working on a PoC with static data between Core and iOS.
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">19:55:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> i believe not, i was only casually complaining about the random switch of topic :)
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">19:55:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> my fault. sry.
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">19:56:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> okay, even simpler-- I think we should change our standard operation to have walletpassphrase and decrypt and sign done by a seperate mlocked process.
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">19:56:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> yes, it should be general enough to support that scenario as well, but I think that's handled if it works for hw signing, just expose a 'virtual' hw device
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">19:56:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> agreed, it's a bit of a sudden switch
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:56:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> time to end the meeting maybe
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">19:57:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#endmeeting</span><span class="cmdline"></span></pre>
