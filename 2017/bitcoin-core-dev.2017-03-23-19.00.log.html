<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> along thsoe lines, I think making some of those 1:1 comments public might be helpful for new devs interested in learning how these processes work
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:03:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> *commemts
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:03:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> IMO QRCode have redundant parts while - as far as I understand bech32 â€“ has also error correction.. seems a bit unefficient. Though QRCode are another layer I guess.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:03:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> (need to read petertodd's response; wasn't aware(
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:03:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> He suggested it use more characters but using anything non-alphanum makes it so double click copy doesn't work in browsers,  also being a non power-of-prime base makes strong error detection infesable, and at best could reduce the size by a couple percent.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:04:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> These points are all addressed in the document, I believe.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> tromp's MiXcAsE proposal was a joke right?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:04:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> base 43 is actually totally doable as it is a prime
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:04:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> there's a few things that the document doesn't mention as clearly as it could, like how non-alphanum poses barriers for non-english-speaking users
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:04:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> I don't think the qr error detection/correction is strong enough for somthing as critical to get right as an address
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:04:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> (in fact in an earlier revision we used - as a seperator but dropped it for click copy compatibility)
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:04:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> but it requires bignum code to convert
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> Yes. Agree.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> feel free to suggest better language :)
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:05:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> it would probably be fine if we only ever used QR codes.. but obviously that isn't possible.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:06:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> will do - also thanks for having such a great list of rationals already! really helpful to understand why something was chosen and what the tradeoffs are
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:06:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> yes, though really being num only be best for international support but the result is significantly bigger and slower to deal with. :(  I tried that out at one point.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:06:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> a more compact format could be used with qr codes, in any case, if that's desirable. That doesn't affect this standard.
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:06:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> QR codes could hypothetically encode it in binary, but meh
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:06:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> rationale section was good, although i think it would be worthwhile to describe the 'exhaustive search'
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:06:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kanzure&gt;</span> in public
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:06:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> right.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:06:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> if we had a binary QR only format I assume it would intentionally begin with something like a null byte to make sure it doesn't get mangled by text channels.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:07:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> yeah, we're fortunate that lots of non-english-speakers still known the alphabet; even english speakers often don't know the names of punctuation symbols, and those names are also not entirely canonical
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:07:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> It's probably not worth to design an additional binary addr standard for QrCodes. Maybe they are only temporary? Gone in 3-4 yrs?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:08:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> There were a lot of other rational things we trimmed from the document. One of pieter's concerns was that the length of the document would make it seem complicated (though the proposal is pretty simple.); feedback on reddit seemed to somewhat validate that.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:08:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> so by matchin QR code's special-case character set support, we end up with an encoding that at the low level is basically binary anyway
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> I think that it's probably not worth it for that, but industry feedback would be nice.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:08:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> thats a point, though the unfortuate thing is that it's exposed to mangling.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> the alphanuneric mode is pretty efficient; only 10% extra compared to binary
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:09:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> it uses 5.5 bits per character
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> e.g. QR decoder -&gt; something that munges up the strings -&gt; software -&gt; coins in sppppaccccceeee.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:09:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> so 5.5 bits per 5 bits of data is pretty goof
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> good
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:09:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> I think the day Qr codes aren't heavily used will be the day bech32 is irrelevant anyway because people are all paying each other by very different means :)
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> probably... :)
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> while base58 uses 8 bits per 5.86 bits of data
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> sipas point is more important, only a 10%-ish overhead in this format vs some binary QR code.
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:10:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> if you also drop the checksum, we get much larger savings of course
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:11:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> in practice you'd get a 25% reduction for p2wpkh
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:11:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> side note: could the Bech32 encoding also be used for private keys (== 32bit seeds)?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:11:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> true. but ugh. the some text handling path replaces a character.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> good question!
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:11:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> indeed, for base58 addresses there also never has been a binary standard for qr codes
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:11:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> we've been thinking about a stronger checksum for private keys
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Anduck&gt;</span> QR codes iirc can work even if 30% of the code misread
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:11:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> which would have saved a lot more
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:12:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> yes - in fact I'm planning on using it for non-bitcoin applications too
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:12:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> possibly 12 checksum characters (which is the maximum doable with 64 bit arithmetic)
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes. An alternative for bip39?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> For private keys additional error _correction_ is interesting, and additional overhead is not very consequential.
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:12:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> bech32 can only correct 2 errors, but detect 4
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:13:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> for addresses you really only care about detection
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:13:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> but for private keys you want correction
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes, quite a different use case
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> So we've been working on that some in the background. So it would be a different spec but just very similar. (e.g. similar kind of 5 lines of code) for the 12 digit checksum or what not.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:13:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> with a 12 character checksum, correcting 3 errors is trivial
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:14:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> current WIF can correct 0.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:14:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> but perhaps we can find one that can correct 4
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:14:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kanzure:</span> we left out a lot of technical manutia about the construction which is interesting but not really relevant to the spec.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:15:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> makes sense to keep the spec focused and minimal, that way people will more likely read it :) you could link to an additional description, or include it as appendix or such
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> earlier version explained finite field arithmetic and generator polynomials :)
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:15:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> maybe good to make it a spec + design document? put rational/etc. in the latter. IIRC SHA3 had a document like that, among others.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:15:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">petertodd:</span> yes indeed
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> The question about the level of complexity: We should't care. Pieter's stuff tend to be complicated. But only because its great and though through well. Awesome work IMO!
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> I haven't fully reviewed it, but I've had a fast read on several versions of the doc and asked questions to sipa
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:16:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Finding a 12-digit code that corrects 4 may take more computing power than we have with just the a hundred cores here... though sipa has done a lot to take that search from completely intractable to plausable. :)   I think this work is a lot lower priority though other things we could be working on (like utxo database refactors and tx compaction) ....
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> i think the result is actually surprisingly simple
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> (but i'm probably biased)
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:17:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> In any case, review and comment please!
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> I think it's more important to *detect* errors, than to correct them
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:18:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> for addresses, absolutely
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> 4 seems a bit low in that regard
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> I think deeply understanding the specs takes a coupe of hours... and it's different to the current base58check. This may frighten off people... but that shouldn't be something that should affect the process of selecting the *next* addr encoding format IMO
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:18:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> for private keys you can generate the resulting wallet and check against the blockchain.. so correcting can be very useful.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:18:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;petertodd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> what do you mean by "4" in the above?

<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:19:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Well it is _guarenteed_ to detect 4 errors, more than 4 you have a 1:2^30 chance of detecting.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:19:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> well it has a 99.9999999068% chance to detect more errors
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:19:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> if I carefully construct gibberish, I'd expect it to be rejected
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:20:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sipa:</span> ah, okay

<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:21:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> great work indeed. From what I remember from our discussions before, the work to derive the function was complex, but afterwards, implementing it is simple. Seems best-case to me :). Will review now that it's final.

<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:21:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> As you can see, if the user's error rate is below 3.53 errors per address entered, this code has better protection than a 32bit hash (like base58 check uses).

To begin with there would need to be an extensive all features all flags test suite... and I think it would be a waste of time to construct that for this format (esp since we're never going to specify BDB itself).
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">19:45:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> we have limited resources, but, fair point

<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">19:47:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> older wallets should *always* work

<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">19:53:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I guess the important thing is that some people do validate it, and can raise a stink if things don't match, which is not possible with random crap executables
