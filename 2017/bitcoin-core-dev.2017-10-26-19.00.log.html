<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:04:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> but is should have been kicked regardless.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:05:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes was about to say that
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:05:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> seems an improvement in any case to kick it :)
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> I was going to say if there was anything stopping 8994, but it needs rebase...
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> ok, I just wasn't sure that it would effect nodes in inbd
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:05:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> Yes, I've had a node running the patch for a few days and after the first day I started cycling out all my outbounds every few hours with the hopes of hitting some broken peers.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:05:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">achow101:</span> yes, it should-- they're useless to us as outbound targets.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:06:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> oh right, duh. outbound..
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:06:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> .yes, this is outbound only
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:06:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> and it avoids acting on 4 peers. so even if it goes nuts and kicks things it shouldn't the damage is limited.

<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sdaftuar:</span> yay
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> tangentially, does it not make sense to take their blockheight in version into consideration? sure it can be spoofed higher, but if it's low and we're in IBD (and presumably they are too), is it worth it to hang around?
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> to reiterite why this specific patch is important; beyond general braindead peer elimination, it addresses the case where you have peers on incompatible consensus rules which you aren't discovering because their chain has less work, so you aren't fetching their invalid blocks.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:08:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> it's a refactor unfortunately, so not sure it is a good candidate for backport to 0.15.  but it was simple to do
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:09:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cfields:</span> well someone could have a lower height but more work chain

<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:11:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> for some reason I thought what we were doing in 11446 was outbound only. I agree that our agressiveness increases here should be outbound only.

<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> ok added 11531
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> it's important that we don't fully partition old nodes during a softfork.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:12:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> it would be better if we could get more granular errors from processnewblockheaders

<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> 11568 is the same as 11446, except it avoids disconnecting hb compact block peers, and only applies to outbound peers
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sdaftuar:</span> ok we should remove one, then :)
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> agreed :)
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:12:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> eh wait 11568 isn't tagged 0.15.0.2 at all
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:13:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> heh, it's getting hard to keep up with these
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:13:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> it was just made

<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> what can we realistically merge before that time?
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:15:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jnewbery:</span> I don't think so - 8305 disconnects under certain conditions, but 10593 disconnects a superset of those conditions
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cfields&gt;</span> i can make plans to be available for building if really necessary
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:15:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> I dont think a sufficient set to make 0.15.0.2 worth it
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:16:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> I think probably if you try you can merge one PR per minute... we could empty out github by then, no problem.. just lots of button pushing!
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;meshcollider&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:16:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> well we have some fixes on the 0.15 branch already that are nice
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:16:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> but I agree it kind of misses the point
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:16:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> anything worth an 0.15.0.2?

<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:17:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> I mean things like #11531, which may be important as far as our b2x-shitshow fixes go, are smack-dab in the middle of consensus code and have not review yet?

<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:21:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> does something else cover the cases 10593 does?

<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:24:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;IniGit&gt;</span> My question is since S is defined as a set of UTXO, but the blockchain does not store each balance in a block, is this set of UTXO only preset in RAM and not on the blockchain. Is it calculated by the node by going thhrough each block since the genesis block and only present in RAM?
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:24:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">BlueMatt:</span> different datadirs..

<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:24:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sdaftuar&gt;</span> are we talking about relaxing bans to be disconnects instead?  i generally agree with that
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:24:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> tbh, so what? our banning is deliberately slow, if you get banned from some small percentage of the network, slowly, over time, for running 2x, sucks for you
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:24:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> if someone on your IP runs a 2X node, your IP gets banned, and you cna't then run or simulataneiously run a core node

<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:25:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> (like one peer per block kinda slow)
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:25:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> I think the concern is if someone runs 2x and gets themselves banned, if they switch back to bitcoin they can't connect to the network anymore

<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:26:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> yes, but this takes longer than a day to cycle through all reachable nodes that way.
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:26:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> so long as not all peers ban, they will eventually find ones with the newer code..
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:26:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> luke-jr's pull should be maybe considered for soon release, in case there is extended period of two chains
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:26:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;karelb&gt;</span> sorry for breaking in, the plan is that you cannot simultaneously run 2x and btc on the same IP? that is unfortunate
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:26:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> but maybe 0.15.1 espeically if its not ready yet
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:26:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> and by that time the first ones will have unbanned them again
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:26:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> even with the peers banning them?

<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> yes, because the banning goes slowly.
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:27:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">karelb:</span> 2x foolishly connects to non-2x nodes and will relay them invalid blocks, so it will get itself banned.
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:27:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> banning also requires blocks to be found, so ...
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:28:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> that means 144 peers to switch through per day, on average
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">19:28:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> just because it hits 20% DoS penalty each header?
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:28:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">karelb:</span> it could have been resolved with e.g. service bits if 2x was willing, but they're insisting on making this a mess, so we have to do the least harmful thing for the existing bitcoin network
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:28:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;karelb&gt;</span> oh OK. That happens with the current core node
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:28:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> <span class="hi">karelb:</span> if you run 2x nodes without their broken -pretendimnot2x then no, you cannot, if you dont use that option, you should be fine

<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:29:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> also as matt points out, if you don't undermine service flag disconnects you won't get banned by bitcoin 0.15+ peers, so I think that answers your concern/.
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:29:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:30:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BlueMatt&gt;</span> if you run with -imstupidandignorereason, you should get banned, thats your problem, not mine
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">19:30:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;karelb&gt;</span> what would be the reason of running that option? what is the incentive for the 2x node to connect to core nodes?
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">19:30:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> in the long run I want to move away from banning more or less entirely but that isn't a thing to worry about for now.

<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">19:38:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> but that's not realistic for 0.15.0.2

<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">19:39:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I think it's worth doing in general, don't care if it doesn't get into 0.15.0.2
