<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:06:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> that PR has an independent combobox for the debug window
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> (including a "no wallet" option)
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:07:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Should rebase on dynamic wallet loading? Or vice-versa?

<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:07:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> The dropdown seems okay isch.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:07:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> IMO GUI should go before dynamic loading
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Ideally we would have a higher-level visual selector
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:07:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Kk
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> ?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:07:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> agree
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> it confusing to have a wallet level switch in the console
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> what's wrong with the combobox ?
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> But I don't see another simple way
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:08:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> One thing that bothers me with the combo is that the gui state is lost
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:08:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> maybe improvements there can be made after merge, if someone thinks of a better way
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:08:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> ?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:08:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> I think it might be confusing to users to have the debug window possibly be for a different wallet than the main wallet gui
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:09:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> the combobox is ok
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> I think its an acceptable first step
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:09:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Like list scroll position, selection, focus, etc
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:09:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sipa&gt;</span> pieter was here
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:09:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> the debug window is supposed to be separate from the main GUI, having it influence what wallet is selected is even more confusing
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:09:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> I think it's perfectly fine for the debug console to be flexible like this. seems just handy to put it there
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:09:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:09:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Another option is one tab per wallet
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:10:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> no, please not
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> maybe (post-merge) an idea might be to have a red alert icon next to the combobox if it doesn't match the main window
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> I was thinking that when you first opened the debug window it could default to the wallet that was in use in the main window
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:10:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> meh
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:10:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> then users can change the wallet if they want to
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:11:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> I think the dropbox is still the best solution on the table,... (even if not ideal)
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:11:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> that sounds reasonable to me
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:11:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I really think having the debug window and main window interact in that way is a mess both in code and in interaction, but anyhow
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:11:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> okay, any other topic?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:11:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> sounds like we at least agree it's a post-merge topic XD
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> ack
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:11:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> oh, if it's a mess in the code, I'm not sure it's worth it. I'll shut up
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> btw why not tabs?
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> multiple tabs with the same console just pointing at a different wallet sounds terrible to me
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> spaces are better
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:12:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> most calls are pure node calls...
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:12:11 </span><span class="nka">* jtimon</span> <span class="ac">hidfdes</span>
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> the tabs are supposed to be for essentially different things
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:12:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> At least you keep track of the correct log
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:12:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> e.g. more charts, more pages of debug info, etc
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jnewbery&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> multiwallet comes first, dynamic loading later
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:13:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jnewbery&gt;</span> *multiwallet GUI comes first
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:13:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Anyway, ack on the order
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> perhaps a log entry after you execute a command on a different wallet than previously (post-merge stuff)
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Ok ok
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:13:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> why not a command to switch between wallets, btw?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> the combobox is great to show what the current wallet is, but shouldn't the wallet be switchable with typing?
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:14:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> /wallet &lt;name&gt; ?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:14:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> for ex.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:14:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> yes... ideally it would be stateless.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:14:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> to ensure one is not executing on the wrong wallet
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> so it would be a gui only command?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> wallet:xyz getnewaddress
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:14:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">achow101:</span> yes
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:14:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> if wallet:&lt;filename&gt; is missing, we get the standard rpcish reject
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> type the wallet name for every command? yes, maybe
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:14:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> It could be part of the "prompt"
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:15:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;MarcoFalke&gt;</span> Needs autocomplete!
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> I think the wallet-selected-state can be dangerous
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:15:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> that's absolutely safest
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jonasschnelli:</span> agree
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:15:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> and it's RPC like
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:15:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:15:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> one can still use arrow-up edit
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:15:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> a gui only command doesn't feel right
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:16:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> nesting is already GUI-only
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jtimon:</span> no, agree, jonasschnelli's proposal to make it stateless and have to provide it for every command is better, that's the same as needs tobe done for bitcoin-cli
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:16:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> yes. It's fine
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:16:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> is this still post-merge, or have we un-concept-ack'd the MW GUI PR?
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Even when there is 1 wallet only?

<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:17:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">promag:</span> that's the exception
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:17:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> both would be okay for me (post merge or now)
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> if it is unambigious then why not

<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:17:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> Ack
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:17:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wumpus:</span> because it'd be really annoying to use?

<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;promag&gt;</span> It's the same with cli
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> yes, it's the same with bitcoin-cli
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> It's maybe annoying... but it's the wallet. Safety first
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> cli is just a testing tool though; it doesn't need to be convenient
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> why wouldn't the debug window just have a combo box
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:18:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> that's the current code

<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:19:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> it's somewhat dangerous; easy to type a command with the wrong one selected
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:19:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jtimon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> some people are worried about a state, not sure what the problem is either
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:19:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">luke-jr:</span> that is not true. cli is probably about as frequently used for using the software as the gui (this probably says some unfortunate things about the gui, but.. :P )
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> could do both, I guess
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:19:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;luke-jr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmaxwell:</span> I highly doubt that!

<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:24:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> it forces people to choose a passphrase which they'll probably forget

The great advantage of wallet encryption by default, as I'd see it, is resolving this mess of having to preserve unencrypted keys.
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:25:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> couldn't we encrypt the wallet by default but not create the wallet by default
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> so you solve the problem of them just clicking through the encryption aspect

<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:25:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> But for that advantage I would recommend a late initilization that doesn't create a wallet until you ask for an address... or go to encrypt it.
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:26:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> you don't make the wallet until it is actually used, and only then do you prompt the user to make a wallet
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:26:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I mean, the only use for encrypting wallets I see is: other people use your computer, and you're afraid of them copying the wallet but not installing a keylogger
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:26:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmaxwell&gt;</span> +1 on the late initilization.
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:26:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I don't think it protects against any other attacks

<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:27:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;achow101&gt;</span> also encryption reduces the file size by like half because unencrypted keys are massive for some reason
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:28:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> another thing that will cause confusion is that for other wallets, the passphrase is the seed

<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">19:28:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morcos&gt;</span> also, this might sound stupid, but if you have a Core-encrypted wallet, you at least know the balance, so you know whether it's worth trying to figure out how to unencrypt it
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">19:29:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> so no, I think focing people to choose a passphrase when first creating their wallet is a bad idea

<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">19:37:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wumpus&gt;</span> I don't think you can do a similar thing for the encrypted keys right now

One possiblity would be to make the recovery key unencrypted by default, and have an advanced dialog that lets you set encryption for it. And support reading in encrypted ones.
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">19:38:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonasschnelli&gt;</span> Yes. That would be great
