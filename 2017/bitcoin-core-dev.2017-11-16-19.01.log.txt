19:01:48 <jonasschnelli> hi
19:01:56 <gmaxwell> will be back in 10 minutes, maybe the meeting won't be over by then. :P
19:02:11 <wumpus> #topic high priority for review
19:02:16 <BlueMatt> new high-priority for me: #11639

19:02:32 <kanzure> hi.
19:02:55 <wumpus> only four things left https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/8
19:03:23 <BlueMatt> also probably worth a post-merge review: #10286 (note that this will likely make lots of open wallet-rpc change conflict silently - you need to add the new BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain call in some wallet rpc functions as boiler plate, see dev docs for more)

19:03:42 <promag> Hi
19:04:15 <luke-jr> should #11383 be on there? I can rebase after the meeting

19:05:12 <wumpus> luke-jr: added
19:05:16 <bitcoin-git> [13bitcoin] 15luke-jr closed pull request #10391: OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT anti-replay (BIP 115; logic only) (06master...06cbah) 02https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10391
19:06:07 <promag> Rpc console still only for 1st wallet right?
19:06:33 <luke-jr> promag: that PR has an independent combobox for the debug window
19:06:46 <luke-jr> (including a "no wallet" option)
19:07:01 <promag> Should rebase on dynamic wallet loading? Or vice-versa?
19:07:01 <wumpus> #topic rpc console for multi wallet
19:07:16 <jonasschnelli> The dropdown seems okay isch.
19:07:23 <luke-jr> promag: IMO GUI should go before dynamic loading
19:07:28 <jonasschnelli> Ideally we would have a higher-level visual selector
19:07:31 <promag> Kk
19:07:38 <luke-jr> jonasschnelli: ?
19:07:41 <jonasschnelli> luke-jr: agree
19:08:09 <jonasschnelli> luke-jr: it confusing to have a wallet level switch in the console
19:08:24 <jtimon> what's wrong with the combobox ?
19:08:30 <jonasschnelli> But I don't see another simple way
19:08:41 <promag> One thing that bothers me with the combo is that the gui state is lost
19:08:45 <luke-jr> maybe improvements there can be made after merge, if someone thinks of a better way
19:08:52 <luke-jr> promag: ?
19:08:56 <achow101> I think it might be confusing to users to have the debug window possibly be for a different wallet than the main wallet gui
19:09:12 <wumpus> the combobox is ok
19:09:16 <jonasschnelli> I think its an acceptable first step
19:09:22 <promag> Like list scroll position, selection, focus, etc
19:09:24 <sipa> pieter was here
19:09:38 <wumpus> the debug window is supposed to be separate from the main GUI, having it influence what wallet is selected is even more confusing
19:09:40 <jtimon> I think it's perfectly fine for the debug console to be flexible like this. seems just handy to put it there
19:09:50 <wumpus> yes
19:09:56 <promag> Another option is one tab per wallet
19:10:02 <wumpus> no, please not
19:10:14 <luke-jr> maybe (post-merge) an idea might be to have a red alert icon next to the combobox if it doesn't match the main window
19:10:43 <achow101> I was thinking that when you first opened the debug window it could default to the wallet that was in use in the main window
19:10:44 <wumpus> meh
19:10:54 <achow101> then users can change the wallet if they want to
19:11:13 <jonasschnelli> I think the dropbox is still the best solution on the table,... (even if not ideal)
19:11:14 <jtimon> that sounds reasonable to me
19:11:18 <wumpus> I really think having the debug window and main window interact in that way is a mess both in code and in interaction, but anyhow
19:11:40 <wumpus> okay, any other topic?
19:11:41 <luke-jr> sounds like we at least agree it's a post-merge topic XD
19:11:45 <jonasschnelli> ack
19:11:48 <jtimon> oh, if it's a mess in the code, I'm not sure it's worth it. I'll shut up
19:11:52 <promag> wumpus: btw why not tabs?
19:12:07 <wumpus> promag: multiple tabs with the same console just pointing at a different wallet sounds terrible to me
19:12:08 <jtimon> spaces are better
19:12:11 <jonasschnelli> promag: most calls are pure node calls...
19:12:11 * jtimon hidfdes
19:12:22 <wumpus> promag: the tabs are supposed to be for essentially different things
19:12:33 <promag> At least you keep track of the correct log
19:12:36 <wumpus> e.g. more charts, more pages of debug info, etc
19:12:42 <jnewbery> promag: multiwallet comes first, dynamic loading later
19:13:04 <jnewbery> *multiwallet GUI comes first
19:13:17 <promag> Anyway, ack on the order
19:13:24 <luke-jr> promag: perhaps a log entry after you execute a command on a different wallet than previously (post-merge stuff)
19:13:42 <promag> Ok ok
19:13:47 <wumpus> why not a command to switch between wallets, btw?
19:14:10 <wumpus> the combobox is great to show what the current wallet is, but shouldn't the wallet be switchable with typing?
19:14:12 <luke-jr> /wallet <name> ?
19:14:16 <wumpus> for ex.
19:14:23 <jonasschnelli> yes... ideally it would be stateless.
19:14:30 <jonasschnelli> to ensure one is not executing on the wrong wallet
19:14:31 <achow101> so it would be a gui only command?
19:14:37 <jonasschnelli> wallet:xyz getnewaddress
19:14:38 <wumpus> achow101: yes
19:14:54 <jonasschnelli> if wallet:<filename> is missing, we get the standard rpcish reject
19:14:55 <wumpus> jonasschnelli: type the wallet name for every command? yes, maybe
19:14:57 <promag> It could be part of the "prompt"
19:15:08 <MarcoFalke> Needs autocomplete!
19:15:17 <jonasschnelli> I think the wallet-selected-state can be dangerous
19:15:18 <wumpus> jonasschnelli: that's absolutely safest
19:15:23 <wumpus> jonasschnelli: agree
19:15:26 <jonasschnelli> and it's RPC like
19:15:35 <wumpus> yes
19:15:39 <jonasschnelli> one can still use arrow-up edit
19:15:43 <jtimon> a gui only command doesn't feel right
19:16:07 <luke-jr> nesting is already GUI-only
19:16:21 <wumpus> jtimon: no, agree, jonasschnelli's proposal to make it stateless and have to provide it for every command is better, that's the same as needs tobe done for bitcoin-cli
19:16:22 <jonasschnelli> yes. It's fine
19:16:59 <luke-jr> is this still post-merge, or have we un-concept-ack'd the MW GUI PR?
19:17:01 <promag> Even when there is 1 wallet only?
19:17:13 <MarcoFalke> promag: No
19:17:17 <wumpus> promag: that's the exception
19:17:22 <jonasschnelli> luke-jr: both would be okay for me (post merge or now)
19:17:24 <wumpus> if it is unambigious then why not
19:17:36 <wumpus> wallet needs to be provided if multiple wallets are loaded
19:17:47 <promag> Ack
19:17:53 <luke-jr> wumpus: because it'd be really annoying to use?
19:17:54 <wumpus> if no wallet is loaded, there's no problem, if one wallet is loaded, then it's clear which one is meant
19:18:14 <wumpus> if mutliple are loaded then wallet commands are ambigious
19:18:19 <promag> It's the same with cli
19:18:26 <wumpus> yes, it's the same with bitcoin-cli
19:18:28 <jonasschnelli> It's maybe annoying... but it's the wallet. Safety first
19:18:36 <luke-jr> cli is just a testing tool though; it doesn't need to be convenient
19:18:36 <gmaxwell> why wouldn't the debug window just have a combo box
19:18:49 <luke-jr> gmaxwell: that's the current code
19:18:57 <jonasschnelli> gmaxwell: I think you will quickly choose the wrong wallet
19:19:11 <wumpus> gmaxwell: it's somewhat dangerous; easy to type a command with the wrong one selected
19:19:17 <jtimon> gmaxwell: some people are worried about a state, not sure what the problem is either
19:19:23 <gmaxwell> luke-jr: that is not true. cli is probably about as frequently used for using the software as the gui (this probably says some unfortunate things about the gui, but.. :P )
19:19:33 <luke-jr> could do both, I guess
19:19:37 <luke-jr> gmaxwell: I highly doubt that!
19:19:46 <achow101> luke-jr: I think there could be some weird interactions with doing both
19:19:55 <wumpus> gmaxwell: there is no clear visual link between what you type and the combobox, though it could be somehow improved by logging in big colorful letters when a different wallet is selected
19:19:58 <luke-jr> both = combobox with in-command override only when no-wallet selected
19:20:03 <wumpus> e.g. ============ current wallet: blabla.dat ===============
19:20:10 <gmaxwell> wumpus: thats a point, the prompt to could also show the wallet.
19:20:21 <wumpus> gmaxwell: yes, indeed
19:20:21 <gmaxwell> and there could be a line written in when it chages, like that.
19:20:31 <jtimon> how is it going to be with the cli again?
19:20:41 <luke-jr> jtimon: no changes needed there
19:20:57 <wumpus> jtimon: for the cli you have to provide the wallet name on every call to select the endpoint ,if it's ambigious, nothing will change there
19:21:11 <gmaxwell> jtimon: cli makes you specify it as a dashed argument to bitcoin-cli, which is a bit obnoxious but works.
19:21:12 <wumpus> decision is to be made about the console
19:21:16 <wumpus> but seems a combobox will do for now
19:21:21 <wumpus> so leave it like that for now luke-jr
19:21:24 <luke-jr> k
19:21:41 <promag> Next?
19:21:41 <jtimon> I see, thanks. just like you have to provide testnet or regtest every time but you don't need that in the GUI
19:21:49 <wumpus> jtimon: yep
19:21:58 <wumpus> GUI can keep state for you that the cli cannot
19:22:11 <wumpus> because it 'captures' the user, unlike a command that's launched every time
19:22:25 <wumpus> yes, other topics?
19:22:50 <achow101> topic suggestion: encrypted wallets by default
19:22:51 <promag> Flat options in rpc?
19:23:11 <wumpus> #topic encrypted wallets by default
19:23:18 <jtimon> I wanted to ask jl2012 about #11398
19:23:20 <gribble> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11398 | Hardcode CSV and SEGWIT deployment by jl2012 · Pull Request #11398 · bitcoin/bitcoin · GitHub
19:23:26 <wumpus> ... why??
19:23:38 <morcos> can someone open an issue about deciding wallet access from the console, i think shipping with it as i understand it to be now seems terrible, but i agree no reason to hold up progress on merging
19:23:43 <jonasschnelli> achow101: with an option to unencrypt later?
19:23:59 <achow101> jonasschnelli: I guess?
19:24:03 <sipa> wumpus: why what?
19:24:09 <wumpus> why encrypt the wallet by default?
19:24:14 <jonasschnelli> achow101: I think that would be great.
19:24:24 <gmaxwell> If you have users encrypt wallets when they open one without any value in it they will reliably lose the key.  The positive confirmation that the user is backed up like electrum has reduces that sort of risk.
19:24:31 <wumpus> it forces people to choose a passphrase which they'll probably forget
19:24:33 <achow101> a lot of wallet software do this now and I don't think people necessarily realize that their wallets are unencrypted until they go to the encrypt wallet option or rpc
19:24:40 <wumpus> I think most people lose money because of losing wallets or losing passphrases not theft
19:24:51 <wumpus> what thread model does encrypting wallets protect against anyhow?
19:24:52 <jonasschnelli> that true on the other hand
19:25:10 <jonasschnelli> Those who have access to support ticket systems of consumer wallets do know that
19:25:21 <luke-jr> wumpus: bad PR
19:25:29 <gmaxwell> Wallet encryption is mostly a tool for people to lose their money but feel better about it because its their own fault.    The great advantage of wallet encryption by default, as I'd see it, is resolving this mess of having to preserve unencrypted keys.
19:25:34 <morcos> couldn't we encrypt the wallet by default but not create the wallet by default
19:25:45 <morcos> so you solve the problem of them just clicking through the encryption aspect
19:25:50 <achow101> morcos: that was the idea I was thinking about
19:25:57 <gmaxwell> But for that advantage I would recommend a late initilization that doesn't create a wallet until you ask for an address... or go to encrypt it.
19:26:06 <achow101> you don't make the wallet until it is actually used, and only then do you prompt the user to make a wallet
19:26:11 <wumpus> I mean, the only use for encrypting wallets I see is: other people use your computer, and you're afraid of them copying the wallet but not installing a keylogger
19:26:20 <gmaxwell> +1 on the late initilization.
19:26:24 <wumpus> I don't think it protects against any other attacks
19:26:46 <morcos> wumpus: you dont think its useful for backups?
19:26:48 <gmaxwell> wumpus: well I really like encryption so that I know that I'm not accidentally going to send funds, but for that it's sufficient to make the key "yes" :P
19:26:59 <luke-jr> morcos: for backups you really want to encrypt the whole thing anyway
19:27:06 <gmaxwell> morcos: ^
19:27:07 <achow101> I have a branch for late initialiation: https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/tree/start-no-wallet
19:27:09 <morcos> i suppose, maybe backups wasn't the right word
19:27:10 <achow101> it doesn't work right now
19:27:30 <morcos> maybe i meant having the wallet to check on things but not worrying too much about it
19:27:34 <wumpus> or maybe the case where e.g. malware in the browser sandbox can grab a fixed file from your computer, but there's no persistent access
19:27:39 <achow101> also encryption reduces the file size by like half because unencrypted keys are massive for some reason
19:28:08 <wumpus> another thing that will cause confusion is that for other wallets, the passphrase is the seed
19:28:15 <luke-jr> wumpus: even when it was introduced, it was acknowledged as mostly just a PR stunt
19:28:20 <wumpus> so people will think that only keeping the passphrase is enough to keep access to their funds
19:28:20 <jtimon> gmaxwell: I was actually scared to suggest a default key for "resolving this mess of having to preserve unencrypted keys"
19:28:31 <wumpus> there are already peple making that mistake now but it's rarer
19:28:37 <wumpus> (because you only have to choose it explicitly)
19:28:40 <luke-jr> achow101: huh? how?
19:28:45 <gmaxwell> +1 for late init,  +1 for positive confirmation recovery backup (like electrum);  -1 for more pressure to encrypt unless the last step is done, +1 for it if the last step is done.
19:28:50 <morcos> also, this might sound stupid, but if you have a Core-encrypted wallet, you at least know the balance, so you know whether it's worth trying to figure out how to unencrypt it
19:29:01 <wumpus> so no, I think focing people to choose a passphrase when first creating their wallet is a bad idea
19:29:07 <achow101> luke-jr: encrypted keys are way smaller than unencrypted ones
19:29:14 <morcos> +1 gmaxwells +/-1's
19:29:20 <luke-jr> how is that even possible?
19:29:33 <promag> Sorry have to be afk
19:29:38 <gmaxwell> luke-jr: because the unencryted keys use some brain damaged openssl encoding
19:29:43 <gmaxwell> that encludes all the curve parameters.
19:29:44 <wumpus> that's just an implementation detail htough; unencrypted keys could be stored smaller, too
19:29:51 <achow101> luke-jr: the format. unencrypted keys are DER format or something. they have the curve params in them
19:29:55 <wumpus> we could encrypt the wallet by default, with an empty passphrase
19:30:02 <luke-jr> ew
19:30:04 <gmaxwell> right, thats a reason to change the format, not a reason to encrypt.
19:30:09 <sipa> achow101: they have field params, curve params, generator, public key and private key in them :)
19:30:17 <sipa> and all of that in inefficient DER
19:30:24 <sipa> 279 bytes total, iirc
19:30:45 <wumpus> yes it's terrible
19:31:26 <wumpus> and doesn't help with anything, if you're going to store the keys in redundant format at least pad it with something that provides error correction
19:31:54 <luke-jr> XD
19:31:54 <BlueMatt> I mean its error correction in case we forget our curve parameters...or something
19:32:03 <sipa> BlueMatt: we actually hardly look at it
19:32:05 <gmaxwell> wumpus: What are your thoughts on, long term:  delayed creation, at create time in the GUI force the user to write down a recovery code (like electrum does; force via reentry and copy/paste jamming).. and have a checkbox to encrypt there too?   recovery code would greatly offset all risks of loss, including lost the passphrase.
19:32:17 <luke-jr> at that size, just store 8 copies of it
19:32:48 <wumpus> gmaxwell: the recovery code would be the HD seed?
19:32:53 <gmaxwell> luke-jr: storing N copies of a key right next to each other hardly helps since disks tend to die a physical sector at a time.
19:32:56 <achow101> gmaxwell: recovery code as in something like bip39?
19:32:58 <gmaxwell> wumpus: yea, an encoding of the HD seed.
19:33:03 <wumpus> gmaxwell: that sounds great to me
19:33:06 <morcos> gmaxwell: encryption using recovery code?
19:33:17 <luke-jr> gmaxwell: sure, but in that case you're screwed with checksums too
19:33:20 <gmaxwell> achow101: not bip39 as it's a brainwallet scheme that can't encode arbritary data, but yes.
19:33:30 <morcos> i also like that idea, but i worry about the importing of private keys...  we'd have to put in a whole lot of warnings about that
19:33:36 <wumpus> achow101: more like other wallets lke electrum's seed phrase
19:33:49 <achow101> wumpus: yes, I would prefer using Electrum's scheme
19:33:53 <wumpus> achow101: (there's a BIP for it but I don't know the number)
19:33:54 <gmaxwell> morcos: I think we need to get to having an import tainted flag on wallets, and warnings about that.
19:33:54 <achow101> that's what we plan to do for Armory
19:34:08 <luke-jr> morcos: importing private keys is already considered dangerous and "never do this"
19:34:21 <wumpus> gmaxwell: I also greatly like the idea of not creating a wallet by default, so starting in no-wallet mode
19:34:22 <jtimon> so what's wrong with the "yes"/default/empty passphrase/key?
19:34:32 <jonasschnelli> the recovery phrase would be unencrypted?
19:34:40 <gmaxwell> achow101: ugg electrum itself. can't encode arbritary data, so it can't work with existing wallets. at least it's better than bip39.
19:34:55 <achow101> jonasschnelli: it would have to be to be able to recover from forgotten passwords
19:35:25 <achow101> gmaxwell: it can't? (I haven't really looked at it)
19:35:27 <jtimon> jonasschnelli: yes, would be public knowledge (and for the user it would be like if none was set) unless you actively set one
19:35:32 <jonasschnelli> achow101: I just worry about people storing those recovery phrases on phones and "plaintext "papers
19:35:34 <gmaxwell> jonasschnelli: I have mixed feelings about that.  I think a best practice is to have your recovery keys encrypted with a WEAK key,  like that insecure password your whole family knows; and there is no risk of it being forgotten... but which a burgler would likely be thwarted, but thats too complex to communicate.
19:36:12 <gmaxwell> jonasschnelli: but we should realize that risk of users losing a strong password is likely orders of magnitude more likely than a local in person attack.
19:36:27 <wumpus> it gets quite complex to manage if the recovery key is encrypted too
19:36:33 * BlueMatt notes that if we do some kind of default-encryption-with-weak-password we should have a clear tag on keys to help out the "shitsihitshit, please scan entire raw disk for anything that looks like a key" use-case
19:36:37 <jonasschnelli> gmaxwell: Indeed. Though people who can take care of a passphase should not be punished
19:36:40 <wumpus> there's the recovery key passphrase, the wallet passphrase,...
19:36:46 <gmaxwell> achow101: unless I'm confused (always likely) it's just a minor fixup of BIP39.
19:37:15 <luke-jr> BlueMatt: +1
19:37:16 <wumpus> BlueMatt: that's where the redundant key format is useful :)
19:37:32 <wumpus> BlueMatt: it greatly helps efficiently scanning for private keys on a disk :p
19:37:38 <BlueMatt> heh, I know
19:37:49 <gmaxwell> BlueMatt: yea, sure, anything key format should have e.g. somethin like the network magic then the private key then a 64 bit crc... and then its cheap to scan the media looking for it.
19:37:54 <wumpus> I don't think you can do a similar thing for the encrypted keys right now
19:38:00 <wumpus> not that they're any use without the master key
19:38:27 <BlueMatt> i mean ideally we'd have a clear tag on both so that such software can prompt the user with "found a wallet, please enter passphrase"
19:38:35 <BlueMatt> but now we're going down a rewrite-wallet-format rabbit hole
19:38:38 <gmaxwell> jonasschnelli: I don't know how to manage the multiple keys case. One possiblity would be to make the recovery key unencrypted by default, and have an advanced dialog that lets you set encryption for it. And support reading in encrypted ones.
19:38:54 <jonasschnelli> Yes. That would be great
19:39:04 <gmaxwell> jonasschnelli: I have a lovely suggestion for hardware wallet friendly KDFs for these things too.
19:39:06 <achow101> BlueMatt: I propose that we just deprecate the wallet :p
19:39:09 <morcos> May I make a meta suggestion.. I think we often lose progress on ideas like this by not having someone document what we discussed.  could we ask for volunteer every time we have a good discussion like this to draft up a plan.
19:39:16 <luke-jr> achow101: I get the feeling often
19:39:16 <jtimon> ack on starting in no-wallet mode
19:39:22 <jonasschnelli> gmaxwell: +1 (happy to hear)
19:39:33 <achow101> morcos: meeting notes writer
19:39:49 <achow101> morcos: he'll write the meeting notes sometime after exams this week
19:39:52 <wumpus> achow101: and then what, change it into an art project where you can look at blocks drifting by, without being able to do anything? :p
19:40:22 <luke-jr> wumpus: write a new one :p
19:40:36 <morcos> yeah but i mena more a focused thing... like after SF devcore -> plan for Segwit wallet  ;   this meeting -> plan for wallet encryption recovery code
19:40:36 <wumpus> luke-jr: you can do that without deprecating anything
19:40:51 <gmaxwell> the block drifting UI should play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z-fyNdnOKE in a loop.
19:41:00 <achow101> I'm scared to click that link
19:41:05 <gmaxwell> it's just music.
19:41:17 <gmaxwell> but we've trained you well.
19:41:52 <sipa> morcos: i've just posted a bit of a writeup/rant on wallet design and segwit support: https://gist.github.com/sipa/125cfa1615946d0c3f3eec2ad7f250a2
19:41:54 <wumpus> morcos: yes, we shouldn't forget segwit wallet
19:41:59 <morcos> woohoo!
19:42:02 <wumpus> morcos: that's the thing people are actually waiting for now :)
19:42:05 <sdaftuar> sipa: thanks!
19:42:08 <gmaxwell> FWIW, sipa has been working on a stronger base=32 BCH code for things like private keys and stealth addresses; which could be an option for recovery codes.
19:42:12 <wumpus> sipa: nice!
19:42:13 <luke-jr> clicking that link won't have permissions for my audio :p
19:42:22 <BlueMatt> when segwit wallet
19:42:30 <achow101> sipa: cool!
19:42:51 <achow101> BlueMatt: soon(tm)
19:43:20 <luke-jr> (mini rant: using #include <…> for our own files is stupid)
19:44:23 <wumpus> luke-jr: sigh, the other alternative would have been to fix all relative includes, but that was discussed in detail in the PR and the one before it
19:45:23 <wumpus> luke-jr: so using #include "../primitive/block.h" in e.g. the wallet. This roots everything at the project root, which is just as unambigious and shorter...
19:45:54 <luke-jr> I just hope /usr/include/primitive/block.h gets ignored
19:46:08 <wumpus> that doesn't get ignored either with ""
19:46:20 <luke-jr> :|
19:47:06 <gmaxwell> obviously we need to rename every header file to filename_bitcoin_core_is_awesome.h
19:47:08 <wumpus> at least not the way we were using it, which is essentially as <>, I think if you use "" relatively you can avoid it
19:48:03 <wumpus> yep!
19:48:03 <luke-jr> gmaxwell: I'm thinking more of malware infecting builds this way
19:48:19 <wumpus> well if your build root is infected you're fucked anyway
19:48:29 <jnewbery> luke-jr: in any case, the PRs were open for a few months (much longer than I would have liked in fact). There was opportunity to comment on those PRs. I think the ship has sailed now.
19:48:40 <luke-jr> true
19:48:57 <wumpus> protecting against that is even more questionable than encrypting your wallet, against any possible realistic threat model
19:49:45 <gmaxwell> luke-jr: well if your host is compromised it's pretty unlikely that it would be limited to only tripping you up with shadowed include files.
19:49:47 <wumpus> jnewbery: indeed, it's almost as if he waited for it to be merged
19:49:57 * BlueMatt nominates #11363 for cfields' high-priority-for-review, cause he apparently isnt here...
19:49:59 <gribble> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11363 | net: Split socket create/connect by theuni · Pull Request #11363 · bitcoin/bitcoin · GitHub
19:50:10 <luke-jr> wumpus: just didn't notice it until rebasing on top of the merged code
19:51:05 <luke-jr> anyhow, #11383 rebase is done

19:51:16 <jonasschnelli> ^^
19:52:33 <jonasschnelli> thanks.. will test
19:52:34 <Dizzle> I like multiwallet. Thanks for working on it, luke-jr. I miss the classic multibit bulk walletting.
19:52:41 <wumpus> luke-jr: anyhow C/C++ including is fragile that way; possible modules https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html will improve that in the future
19:53:13 <sipa> yay c++20... which we'll switch to in 20125?
19:53:19 <sipa> *2025
19:53:24 <wumpus> yes, in 20125
19:53:31 <luke-jr> :x
19:53:33 <Chris_Stewart_5> ack
19:53:36 <meshcollider> lol
19:53:39 <jonasschnelli> heh
19:53:53 <gmaxwell> change in topic, anyone have recent stats for the number of remaining btc1 nodes-- which are likely about to become a distributed DOS attack on the bitcoin network?
19:53:56 <wumpus> BlueMatt: will add that one
19:54:40 <wumpus> #topic DDoS network stats
19:54:59 <meshcollider> gmaxwell:  https://coin.dance/nodes says 139 but maybe not what you're after?
19:55:12 <luke-jr> (I'm going to drop as soon as the meeting is officially over. I'll be back a few minutes later in case there's stuff to talk about)
19:55:19 <jonasschnelli> I can filter my seed crawler for uagent string?
19:55:23 <gmaxwell> meshcollider: ha. I didn't expect them to shut off that fast, I guess they were really almost all just a couple people sybling.
19:55:35 <gmaxwell> meshcollider: okay, probably not much to worry about.
19:56:24 <meshcollider> gmaxwell yeah lol there was a Reddit post which went into some detail showing 90% were hosted by AWS
19:56:35 <wumpus> PSA before the meeting is over: I want to collect corrupted leveldb files, if you have a leveldb corruption please patch https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11674 and send me the indicated corrupted file.
19:57:10 <jonasschnelli> 861 peers with "Bitcoin ABC" and 100% uptime during last two hours.
19:57:24 <luke-jr> jonasschnelli: that's just BCH
19:57:25 <achow101> gmaxwell: my btc1 node is connected to 34 other btc1 nodes, so at least 35
19:57:26 <meshcollider> ABC is not btc1
19:57:35 <BlueMatt> i mean its what we did 0.15.1 for, no?
19:58:10 <gmaxwell> BlueMatt: yes, sure I wanted to know how many there weer because if there were thousands I'd make a post on reddit to urge people to upgrade to 0.15+ seems it might not be needed.
19:58:11 <jonasschnelli> meshcollider: what uagent does btc1 uses?
19:58:25 <luke-jr> jonasschnelli: /Satoshi:1.*/
19:58:30 <jonasschnelli> ah
19:58:41 <achow101> jonasschnelli: most have a uacomment with "2x"
19:58:46 <jonasschnelli> 107
19:58:55 <gmaxwell> with only 140ish it's pretty unlikely many nodes will get isolated behind them.
19:59:25 <achow101> what block were they forking at?
19:59:30 <achow101> (I need to add it to my site)
19:59:34 <gmaxwell> 494784
19:59:55 <jtimon> weren't they using a naming just the same as bitcoin core but increasing a version? (ie 0.14.3)
20:00:03 <gmaxwell> hopefully someone will mine a couple blocks on that fork to help get those nodes disconnected.
20:00:21 <gmaxwell> jtimon: they made the major version 1.
20:00:26 <achow101> gmaxwell: a mining pool announced that they would go with the 2x fork regardless
20:00:27 <jtimon> oh, right
20:00:27 <jnewbery> won't they disconnect themselves once a valid block is found?
20:00:34 <wumpus> ding dong
20:00:40 <gmaxwell> achow101: that was 'bitpico' who is crazy.
20:00:53 <gmaxwell> it's meaningless.
20:00:59 <achow101> oh
